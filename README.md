For our hackathon project, our team of three developed a simple yet engaging card game. Users can choose the grid size, and when they turn over a card, they aim to reveal either a dog or cat image. Revealing the dog image results in a loss, while uncovering the cat image leads to a win. We integrated APIs to fetch dog and cat images and used a random color API to assign vibrant colors to the cards, enhancing the visual appeal of the game. This project showcased our ability to collaborate effectively and create an interactive user experience.
